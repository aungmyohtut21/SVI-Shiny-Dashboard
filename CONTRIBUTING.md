# Contributing to the SVI Dashboard for Portland, ME

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SVI Dashboard! This dashboard was created using R Shiny to visualize the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) for Portland, Maine. It features sections for Maps, Plot, Data Table, and About. I appreciate contributions that help improve functionality, design, and user experience.

## Project Overview
The SVI Dashboard includes:

* Maps: Visual representation of SVI data by geographic areas.
* Plot: Graphical insights into key SVI indicators.
* Data Table: Tabular view of data with a Data Dictionary button that should link users to the data dictionary webpage for variable names and descriptions and Download button.
* About: Provides background information on SVI and the project's purpose.

## How to Contribute
### Reportin Issues
If you encounter a bug or have suggestions, please open an issue with:

* A clear title and description of the issue.
* Steps to reproduce the bug (if applicable).
* Screenshots or error messages, if possible.

### Fixing the Data Dictionary Button
Currently, the Data Dictionary button in the Data Table section does not link to the data dictionary web page. This button should redirect users to the original data dictionary page, where they can view variable names and explanations. If you are interested in fixing this issue, please reference the issue number associated with this task in your branch and pull request.

### Making Enhancements
Welcome any suggestions or contributions for enhancing the dashboard, such as:
