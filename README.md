# SVI Dashboard for Portland, ME
Welcome to the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) Dashboard for Portland, Maine. This dashboard, built using R Shiny, provides a visual and interactive representation of the Social Vulnerability Index for Portland. It helps policymakers, public health professionals, and community members understand the various factors contributing to social vulnerability and identify communities that may need additional support.

## Project Overview
The Social Vulnerability Index, developed by the CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), is a measure that identifies communities vulnerable to adverse health outcomes during public health emergencies. The SVI Dashboard makes these insights accessible by displaying data across multiple dimensions through interactive maps, plots, and tables.

## Features

* Maps: Visual representation of SVI data by geographic area, allowing users to see variations in social vulnerability across different tracts in Portland.
* Plot: Graphs and visualizations of specific SVI indicators, providing detailed insights into the distribution and range of vulnerability metrics.
* Data Table: A tabular view of the data used in the dashboard, with a Data Dictionary button designed to link users to the official data dictionary webpage for further reference.
* About: Background information on the Social Vulnerability Index, its purpose, and how to interpret the data displayed in the dashboard.
